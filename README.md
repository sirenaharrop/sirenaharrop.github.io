# sirenaharrop.github.io

This is a simple webpage I made. My corner of the internet where I detail a small about me, host a simplified resume, have links to my important socials, and more. 

I could've used a template but I decided that my web development skills needed some work so I decided to create it from scratch.

shout out to W3 schools for carrying me thru all of this <3
