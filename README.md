# sirenaharrop.github.io

This is a simple webpage I made. My corner of the internet where I detail a small about me, host a simplified resume, have links to my important socials, and more. 

I could've used a template but I decided that my web development skills needed some work so I decided to create it from scratch.

## Installation

If you want to host this locally for some reason (?) just clone the repo and open the index.html file in your browser :P

## License/Details

I probably won't publish this publicly but if this get's out there don't copy this please!
